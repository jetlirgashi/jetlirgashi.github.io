Hi, Im Jetlir,
A Highly accomplished IT Support and Cyber Security Engineer, driven by a relentless 
pursuit of results and a fervent dedication to addressing intricate technical dilemmas 
while fortifying data security measures. I aspire to harness my extensive proficiency in 
IT support and cyber security as a stepping stone into the realm of DevOps  Engineering. 
With an unwavering commitment to ongoing self-improvement, I am poised to harness 
my mastery in infrastructure administration, automation, and cloud technologies to
